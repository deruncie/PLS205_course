## PLS 205 - Experimental Design and Analysis

This course is taught by [Dr. Daniel Runcie](runcielab.ucdavis.edu) at UC Davis during the winter quarter. 

The goal of this course is to introduce graduate students in the biological sciences to the fundamental concepts and statistical methods necessary to plan, conduct, and interpret effective experiments.

### Course Format
The course consists of two 1.5-hour lectures, one hour of computer laboratory, and one homework assignment per week.  

The [Online Course](Course_content.md) contains all lectures, lab tutorials and homework assigments from Winter Quarter 2020. The material is grouped into weekly blocks consisting of two lectures, one lab, and one homework. General topics for each week are listed.

### General course outline

- Introduction to Experimental Design
- Properties of samples: mean, variance, standard errors
- Confidence intervals
- T-tests, decision theory
- Sub-sampling, optimal designs
- Multiple comparisons
- ANOVA
- Trend-analysis
- Randomized Complete Block Designs
- Factorial experiments
- Split Plot designs
- Incomplete designs
- Using covariates
- Missing data

### Learning Objectives
Learning Objectives

Upon completion of the course, students should be able to:

- Identify objectives of a field, greenhouse or laboratory experiment and outline the scientific methods that would be used to meet those objectives.
- Select an efficient experimental design to meet the objectives of an experiment and justify your choice of designs.
- Select suitable plot sizes, shapes, and placement to control experimental error.
    - Determine when blocking is needed and demonstrate how blocks are arranged in field experiments.
    - Determine if factorial designs are necessary. Explain the meaning of main effects and interactions and show how they impact the interpretation of results.
	- Distinguish nested and cross-classified factors in an experimental design.
	- Explain the difference between fixed and random effects
	- Explain the difference between subsampling and true replication.
	- Explain the purpose of repeated measures analyses and identify experimental circumstances for which they would be appropriate
	- Evaluate the utility of covariates
	- Compare strengths and weakness of the following experimental designs, and generate randomizations using R:
		- Completely Randomized Design
		- Randomized Complete Block Design
		- Split-Plot Design
		- Augmented Design
		- Incomplete block designs
- Use R to import and analyze data, create graphs and produce reports
	- Summarize data, create graphs and produce statistical reports using R
	- Calculate the power of an experiment to detect differences among treatments. 
	- Determine optimal plot size and the number of replications needed to meet experimental objectives.
	- Describe the assumptions required for a valid ANOVA and apply diagnostic tools to determine if the assumptions are met. Utilize appropriate data transformations and discuss other approaches for analyzing data that do not satisfy ANOVA assumptions.
	- Compare treatment means using appropriate mean separation techniques and form contrasts to answer specific research questions.
	- Interpret the output of fixed and random effect models 
	- Produce appropriate summaries of results including:
		- p-values, statements of significance, effect size estimates and confidence intervals
